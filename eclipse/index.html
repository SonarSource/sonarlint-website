                    <p>
                        You can bind Eclipse projects to a SonarQube project (supporting SonarQube servers 5.6+). This operation will make SonarLint use
                        the analyzers, quality profiles and settings defined on your SonarQube server. This is a convenient way of customizing the rules used by SonarLint.
                    </p>
                    <p>First step is to configure connection with the SonarQube server:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In SonarQube server view, right click and choose 
                        "New -> Server connection", or directly do "File -> New -> Other... -> SonarLint -> New Server".</li>
                            <li>Complete connection details (URL and credentials).</li>
                            <li>When using sonarqube.com set your organization. Leave blank for on premise servers or when using default organization.</li>
                            <li>Test connection</li>
                            <li>Click "Finish" to close the wizard. A background process will start updating configuration from the server (may take a while)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/images/connected-add-server.png"/>
                    <p>
                        You can manage your SonarQube server connections in the "SonarQube Servers" view.
                        Note: To manually trigger an update of local configuration (if remote SonarQube configuration has changed): right click on a server and use the "Update all project bindings" action.
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/images/connected-update-config.png"/>
                    <p>
                        Now you can bind one or more Eclipse project(s) to their remote SonarQube pair. Right click on Eclipse project -> "SonarLint -> Bind with remote SonarQube server..."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can now use the wizard to find the matching SonarQube project. Give a try to the "auto-bind" feature that will find best match based on Eclipse project name.
                        If auto-bind fail you can manually search for a project.
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/images/connected-binding-search.png"/>
                    <p>
                        Click on "Finish" to persist the binding. You should now see the SonarQube overlay on your bound Eclipse project icon.
                    </p>
                    <img src="resources/images/connected-overlay-icon.png"/>
                    <p>
                        That's it, you can now code and see SonarLint reporting issues based on remote SonarQube configuration.
                    </p>

                            <div class="answer">
                              <p>SonarLint analysis is automatically triggered by a resource change listener (in short: when a file is modified) and also when you open a file.</p>
                              <p>If you want to disable the automatic analysis: go to project properties (right click on the project -> Properties), select SonarLint entry and uncheck "Enable SonarLint on-the-fly"</p>
                              <p><strong>When on-the-fly analysis is disabled</strong> you can manually run SonarLint analysis using context menu on each source file: <img src="resources/images/run-analysis-menu.png"/></p>

                            <div class="answer">
                              <p>SonarLint supports only the SonarSource Analyzers (SonarJava, SonarJS, ...) and also custom rules extending these SonarSource analyzers.</p>
                              <p>We don't plan to support plugins running third-party analyzers (like PMD, Android Lint, JSLint...). Most of the time those analyzers already have dedicated IDE integration.</p>

                                <p>By default we are excluding derived files. Apart from that all files recognized as a supported language are analyzed. In connected mode you can configure some exlusions on server side.</p>

                                <p>The SonarLint console allow to see logs of the analysis. This can be useful to understand some technical issues. You can open it from standard Eclipse Console views: <img src="resources/images/open-sonarlint-console.png"/></p>

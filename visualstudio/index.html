                            In addition to the new rules, we focused mainly on user experience. Unused or unneeded code is faded out in the IDE, so low severity warnings
                            don't pollute the Error Window any more. We also fixed a few false positives. Don't forget to check out the

                    Using the same value on either side of a binary operator is almost always a mistake. In the case of logical operators, it is either a copy-paste error and
                    therefore a bug, or it is simply wasted code, and should be simplified. <a href="rules/index.html#ruleId=S1764">Rule S1764</a>

                    Performing a null-check before referencing an object is a good practice, but when either the equality operator in the null test or the logical operator that
                    follows it is reversed, it leads to a guaranteed null pointer dereference. <a href="rules/index.html#ruleId=S1697">Rule S1697</a>
